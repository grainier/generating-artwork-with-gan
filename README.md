# generating-artwork-with-gan
This project focuses on building and training GANs to generate artwork in the style of famous painters, like Monet, producing images that resemble real artwork. It aligns with the Kaggle competition "I'm Something of a Painter Myself," offering a platform to practice generative deep learning models.
