# Generating Artwork with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

In this project, we aim to build and train Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate artwork in the style of famous painters, such as Monet. The objective is to create a model capable of producing new images that are indistinguishable from real artwork. This aligns with the Kaggle competition ["I'm Something of a Painter Myself"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started/overview), which provides a platform to practice building and training generative deep learning models.

The Kaggle notebook for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/grainier/generating-artwork-with-gans/notebook).
